              Hi, I'm a front-end developer. I work/would love to work with
              small to large companies, startups, web dev studios, and creative
              individuals globally.
            </h3>
            <p>
              With over 5 years of web dev experience, Iâ€™m passionate about
              creating digital experiences that are both captivating and
              seamless. I specialize in crafting interactive, detail-driven
              websites that balance functionality with beautiful design. For me,
              bringing ideas to life and turning them into tailored,
              user-friendly platforms is incredibly rewarding.
              <br />
              <br />
              More than anything, I love meeting new people value building
              meaningful connections and collaborating with creative minds who
              share the same passion for design and innovation.
              <br />
              <br />
              When I'm not coding or designing, I can be found reading a
              fanatasy book or hanging out with my friends.
